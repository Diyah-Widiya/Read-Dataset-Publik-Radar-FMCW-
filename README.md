# Signal Processing for Radar Dataset

In this code, we perform the reading of a public dataset and process radar signals to obtain respiration and heart rate signals. The public dataset can be accessed through [this link](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Radar_recorded_child_vital_sign_dataset_and_deep_learning-based_age_group_classifier_for_vehicular_application/13515977/1). We have made modifications in the signal processing section to produce measurements of heart rate and respiration rate.
